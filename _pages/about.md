I am a master's student majoring in Computer Science at [Columbia University](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/). Prior to beginning my master's degree, I completed my undergraduate studies at [Waseda University](https://www.comm.waseda.ac.jp/en/index.html), where I conducted research in image and video processing at Advanced Multimedia Systems Lab ([AMS](https://www.ams.giti.waseda.ac.jp/)) under the supervision of Prof. Hiroshi Watanabe. My academic journey has been defined by a strong foundation and experience in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and computer vision.

During my undergraduate years, I led a research project on real-time object detection systems using edge-cloud cooperative neural networks as my senior research project. In addition to my research project, I conducted joint research internship at [NTT](https://www.rd.ntt/e/sic/). I also did research internship at Multimedia Signal Processing Group ([MMSPG](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/mmspg/)) headed by Prof. Touradj Ebrahimi at [Swiss Federal Technology Institute of Lausanne (EPFL)] (https://www.epfl.ch/en/), where I worked on a study on the impact of learning-based image compression methods, including the upcoming JPEG AI standard, on computer vision tasks 

Currently, at Columbia, I am deepening my knowledge in areas such as machine learning, databases, and user interface design through courseworks and projects.

Beyond academics, I am passionate sharing knowledge and fostering communities through teaching assitant, English-Japanese translator, and club sport organizer. In my free time, I enjoy playing and watching sports (tennis, badminton, baseball, soccer).

I aim to leverage my technical expertise, research experience, and collaborative skills to contribute to impactful innovations, particularly in the intersection of technology and user experience.
