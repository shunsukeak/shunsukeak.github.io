I am a master's student majoring in Computer Science at Columbia University. Before pursuing my master's degree, I completed my undergraduate studies at Waseda University, where I worked on image/video processing research at Advanced Multimedia Lab supervised by professor Hiroshi Watanabe. My academic journey has been defined by a strong foundation and experience in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and computer vision.

During my undergraduate years, I led a research project on real-time object detection systems using edge-cloud cooperative neural networks as my senior research project. In addition to my research project, I conducted joint research internship at NTT research team. I also did research internship at Multimedia Signal Processing Group headed by Prof. Touradj Ebrahimi at Swiss Federal Technology Institute of Lausanne (EPFL), where I worked on the investigation about the impact of learning-based image compression methods including future JPEG AI standard on computer vision tasks. 

Currently, at Columbia, I am deepening my knowledge in areas such as machine learning, databases, and user interface design through courseworks and projects.

Beyond academics, I am passionate sharing knowledge and fostering communities through teaching assitant, English-Japanese translator, and club sport organizer. In my free time, I enjoy playing and watching sports (tennis, badminton, baseball, soccer).

I aim to leverage my technical expertise, research experience, and collaborative skills to contribute to impactful innovations, particularly in the intersection of technology and user experience.
